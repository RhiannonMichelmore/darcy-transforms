## Usage
To use this in your own website, go to `index.html` file and copy the first part labelled COPY (from the start of the `<div id="darcy-container">` to the end of that `div`, again all labelled) ANYWHERE in your own webpage. Finally copy the two script sources labelled copy at the bottom of the file, to the BOTTOM of your webpage just above the end of body tag.

ALTERNATIVELY, use/rename my `index.html` file and change what you would like/add text around etc (I recommend not changing anything in the labelled for copy areas because this will probably break it). 

Make sure the all of the javascript (.js) files are in the same folder as your webpage.

N.B. YOU NEED JQUERY FOR THIS TO WORK: If you do not already have this line in the `<head>` of your webpage, please add it:
	```<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>```
